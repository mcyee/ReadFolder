## ReadFolder

This script reads the contents of the given folder and saves the file/directory names into a tree to manipulate.

For example, a folder containing the following:

`folder1/
folder2/
file1
file2`

would be organised like so:

`main = [folder1: folder, folder2: folder, file1: file, file2: file]`
